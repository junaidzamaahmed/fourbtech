            As more people rely on search engines to find information, SEO has
            become more competitive and complex. Outdated practices like keyword
            stuffing no longer work - instead, SEO today involves a wide range
            of strategic elements that establish a website&apos;s authority,
            relevance, and visibility.

          <p>Here are some of the core components of effective SEO:</p>

              <h3 className="flex items-center font-medium">

                Search Engine Results Page (SERP) Rankings
              </h3>
              <p className="pl-4">
                SERPs are the pages that appear when someone performs a search
                on platforms like Google or Bing. According to industry data,
                websites listed on the first page of Google capture around 71%—
                and in some cases up to 92%—of search traffic clicks. In
                contrast, results on the second page receive only about 6% of
                clicks. To gain meaningful visibility and attract more visitors,
                itapos;s crucial to rank on the first page of search results.

                Organic Traffic
              </h3>
              <p className="pl-4">
                Organic traffic refers to visitors who land on your website
                through unpaid search results, as opposed to clicking on paid
                advertisements. This type of traffic is considered highly
                valuable because it&aos;s earned rather than bought—and it
                doesn&aos;t cost you money with each click. SEO focuses on
                increasing this type of unbiased search engine-recommended
                traffic, which tends to be more sustainable and trustworthy.

                Quality Of Traffic
              </h3>
              <p className="pl-4">
                Attracting more visitors is only valuable if those users are
                genuinely interested in your offerings. SEO helps connect your
                business with people who are actively searching for what you
                provide. This improves the quality of traffic to your site and
                boosts the likelihood of conversions, turning visitors into
                customers.
